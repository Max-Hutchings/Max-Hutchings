## MyJourney
### First 4 Months self-teaching

### First independent project (Month 4 of self-teaching) - FULL STACK Trello-like note-taking app
https://github.com/Max-Hutchings/NoteNest 
1. I put my tech stack into practice by building a Trello-like note-taking app from scratch.
2. **TECH: ** Django, React.js, Redux, Drag-and-Drop Kit,  SQLite3, HTML and vanilla CSS.
3. **FUNCTIONALITY: ** This app allows a user to create an account, and load their notes dashboard. A user can add note sections with custom titles, and then add notes to each section. Drag and drop functionality is implemented for users to drag a note from one section to the other. The user can also tick off notes when completed, putting a line through the note content. When appropriate, the user can click "clear completed notes", which moves all completed notes to a new (automatically created) "Completed Notes" section.
